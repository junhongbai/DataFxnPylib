# calculation of synthetic accessibility score as described in:
#
# Estimation of Synthetic Accessibility Score of Drug-like Molecules based on Molecular Complexity and Fragment Contributions
# Peter Ertl and Ansgar Schuffenhauer
# Journal of Cheminformatics 1:8 (2009)
# http://www.jcheminf.com/content/1/1/8
#
# several small modifications to the original paper are included
# particularly slightly different formula for marocyclic penalty
# and taking into account also molecule symmetry (fingerprint density)
#
# for a set of 10k diverse molecules the agreement between the original method
# as implemented in PipelinePilot and this implementation is r2 = 0.97
